# Project Description
Model Fitness, a gym lost 26.5% of its customers in the present month. If the gym don't balance out this share by acquiring new customers, the company will become less profitable. As such, it is a no-brainer to develop strategies to prevent customer churn as well as possible. 

The task as a data analyst is to:
* analyze the customer profiles and come up with a customer retention strategy.
* identify target groups.
* suggest measures to cut churn.
